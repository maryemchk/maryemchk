## Beyond Code
- **Design Enthusiast** 🎨 - UI mockups in Figma | Color-theory nerd | UX = Trust believer
- **Event Architect** 🎪 - Planning tech events | Budgets, stage design, swag & logistics
- **Beauty & Skincare Fan** 💄 - Testing serums | Shade-matching tech enthusiast

**Design Philosophy (expandable)**:  
"Good design is invisible, but unforgettable."  
I believe every pixel matters — from kerning to color temperature. Whether it's a UI component, an event stage, or a lipstick shade, I notice the details that make experiences feel right. Design is trust, and trust is everything.
